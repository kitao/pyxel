## How to Install

There are two types of Pyxel, a packaged version and a standalone version.

### Install Packaged Version

The packaged version of Pyxel uses Pyxel as a Python extension module.

Recommended for those who are familiar with managing Python packages using the `pip` command or who want to develop full-fledged Python applications.

**Windows**

After installing [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.7 or higher), run the following command:

```sh
pip install -U pyxel
```

**Mac**

After installing [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.7 or higher), run the following command:

```sh
pip3 install -U pyxel
```

**Linux**

After installing the SDL2 package (`libsdl2-dev` for Ubuntu), [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.7 or higher), and `python3-pip`, run the following command:

```sh
sudo pip3 install -U pyxel
```

If the above doesn't work, try self-building by following the steps below after installing `cmake` and `rust`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kitao/pyxel.git
cd pyxel
make clean all
sudo pip3 install .
```

### Install Standalone Version

The standalone version of Pyxel uses Pyxel as a standalone tool that does not depend on Python.

Recommended for those who want to start programming easily without worrying about Python settings, or those who want to play Pyxel games immediately.

**Windows**

Download and run the latest version of the Windows installer (`pyxel-[version]-windows-setup.exe`) from the [Download Page](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel/releases).

**Mac**

After installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run the following commands:

```sh
brew tap kitao/pyxel
brew install pyxel
```

**Linux**

After installing the SDL2 package (`libsdl2-dev` for Ubuntu) and installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run the following commands:

```sh
brew tap kitao/pyxel
brew install pyxel
```

If the above doesn't work, try self-building the packaged version.

## How to Use

### Create Pyxel Application

After importing the Pyxel module in your python script, specify the window size with `init` function first, then starts the Pyxel application with `run` function.

```python
import pyxel

pyxel.init(160, 120)

def update():
    if pyxel.btnp(pyxel.KEY_Q):
        pyxel.quit()

def draw():
    pyxel.cls(0)
    pyxel.rect(10, 10, 20, 20, 11)

pyxel.run(update, draw)
```

The arguments of `run` function are `update` function to update each frame and `draw` function to draw screen when necessary.

In an actual application, it is recommended to wrap pyxel code in a class as below:

```python
import pyxel

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        pyxel.init(160, 120)
        self.x = 0
        pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

    def update(self):
        self.x = (self.x + 1) % pyxel.width

    def draw(self):
        pyxel.cls(0)
        pyxel.rect(self.x, 0, 8, 8, 9)

App()
```

It is also possible to write simple code using `show` function and `flip` function to draw simple graphics and animations.

`show` function displays the screen and waits until the `Esc` key is pressed.

```python
import pyxel

pyxel.init(120, 120)
pyxel.cls(1)
pyxel.circb(60, 60, 40, 7)
pyxel.show()
```

`flip` function updates the screen once.

```python
import pyxel

pyxel.init(120, 80)

while True:
    pyxel.cls(3)
    pyxel.rectb(pyxel.frame_count % 160 - 40, 20, 40, 40, 7)
    pyxel.flip()
```

### Run Pyxel Application

The created Python script can be executed with the following command:

```sh
pyxel run PYTHON_SCRIPT_FILE
```

For the packaged version, it can be executed like a normal Python script:

```sh
cd pyxel_examples
python3 PYTHON_SCRIPT_FILE
```

(For Windows, type `python` instead of `python3`)

### Special Controls

The following special controls can be performed while a Pyxel application is running:

- `Esc`<br>
Quit the application
- `Alt(Option)+1`<br>
Save the screenshot to the desktop
- `Alt(Option)+2`<br>
Reset the recording start time of the screen capture video
- `Alt(Option)+3`<br>
Save the screen capture video to the desktop (up to 10 seconds)
- `Alt(Option)+0`<br>
Toggle the performance monitor (fps, update time, and draw time)
- `Alt(Option)+Enter`<br>
Toggle full screen

### How to Create Resource

Pyxel Editor can create images and sounds used in a Pyxel application.

It starts with the following command:

```sh
pyxel edit [PYXEL_RESOURCE_FILE]
```

If the specified Pyxel resource file (.pyxres) exists, the file is loaded, and if it does not exist, a new file is created with the specified name.
If the resource file is omitted, the name is `my_resource.pyxres`.

After starting Pyxel Editor, the file can be switched by dragging and dropping another resource file. If the resource file is dragged and dropped while holding down ``Ctrl(Cmd)`` key, only the resource type (Image/Tilemap/Sound/Music) that is currently being edited will be loaded. This operation enables to combine multiple resource files into one.

The created resource file can be loaded with `load` function.

Pyxel Editor has the following edit modes.

**Image Editor:**

The mode to edit the image banks.

<img src="doc/images/image_editor.gif">

By dragging and dropping an image file (png/gif/jpeg) onto the Image Editor screen, the image can be loaded into the currently selected image bank.

**Tilemap Editor:**

The mode to edit tilemaps in which images of the image banks are arranged in a tile pattern.

<img src="doc/images/tilemap_editor.gif">

**Sound Editor:**

The mode to edit sounds.

<img src="doc/images/sound_editor.gif">

**Music Editor:**

The mode to edit musics in which the sounds are arranged in order of playback.

<img src="doc/images/music_editor.gif">

### Other Resource Creation Methods

Pyxel images and tilemaps can also be created by the following methods:

- Create an image from a list of strings with `Image.set` function or `Tilemap.set` function
- Load an image file (png/gif/jpeg) in Pyxel palette with `Image.load` function

Pyxel sounds can also be created in the following method:

- Create a sound from strings with `Sound.set` function or `Music.set` function

Please refer to the API reference for usage of these functions.

### How to Distribute Application

Pyxel supports a dedicated application distribution file format (Pyxel application file) that works across platforms.

Create the Pyxel application file (.pyxapp) with the following command:

```sh
pyxel package APP_ROOT_DIR STARTUP_SCRIPT_FILE
```

If the application should include resources or additional modules, place them in the application folder.

The created application file can be executed with the following command:

```sh
pyxel play PYXEL_APP_FILE
```

## API Reference

### System

- `width`, `height`<br>

Initialize the Pyxel application with screen size (`width`, `height`). The following can be specified as options: the window title with `title`, the frame rate with `fps`, the key to quit the application with `quit_key`, the scale of the display with `display_scale`, the scale of the screen capture with `capture_scale`, and the maximum recording time of the screen capture video with `capture_sec`.<br>
e.g. `pyxel.init(160, 120, title="My Pyxel App", fps=60, quit_key=pyxel.KEY_NONE, capture_scale=3, capture_sec=0)`

- `run(update, draw)`<br>
Start the Pyxel application and call `update` function for frame update and `draw` function for drawing.

- `show()`<br>
Show the screen and wait until the `Esc` key is pressed. (Do not use in normal applications)

- `flip()`<br>
Updates the screen once. (Do not use in normal applications)

- `quit()`<br>
Quit the Pyxel application.

### Resource

- `load(filename, [image], [tilemap], [sound], [music])`<br>

### Advanced APIs

Pyxel has "advanced APIs" that are not mentioned in this reference because they "may confuse users" or "need specialized knowledge to use".

If you are familiar with your skills, try to create amazing works with [this](pyxel/__init__.pyi) as a clue!
